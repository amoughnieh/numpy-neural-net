# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch

This notebook implements a fully connected neural network using only NumPy. It defines a modular Object-Oriented structure with classes for Linear layers, Sigmoid activation, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss. The code covers the full training pipeline, manual backpropagation, and matrix calculus, with a bonus section classifying a non-linear 2D spiral dataset.

## Contents

* `neural_net_tutorial.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the network classes, backpropagation logic, and training loops.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the implementation and run the training experiments:

```bash
jupyter notebook neural_net_tutorial.ipynb
